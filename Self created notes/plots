IMPORTANT:
For categorical variable, following things are useful
- value_count - shows frequencies
- crosstab - can be used for a single categorical variable to see frequencies or to see the frequencies by showing the relation between two categorical variables
- countplot - can be used for a single categorical variable or for two categorical variables to see the frequencies
- boxplot - can be used for a single categorical variable or for comparing a categorical variable with a numerical variable. shows min, median, max analysis (like describe() method).
            shows min, median, max, 25%(first quartile), 50%(second quartile), 75% analysis(third quartile), like describe() method

For numerical variable, following things are useful
- histplot/displot - shows frequency distribution
- boxplot - shows min, median, max, 25%(first quartile), 50%(second quartile), 75% analysis(third quartile), like describe() method
- regplot (same as scatterplot with or without regression line) - to compare two numerical variables

antecedents	    Items on the left-hand side of the rule (the "if" part)
consequents	    Items on the right-hand side (the "then" part)
support	        % of transactions that contain both sides
confidence	    Probability of consequents given antecedents (`P(B
lift	        How much more likely B is, given A, compared to random occurrence
'''

'''
fpgrowth	        Finds itemsets that meet a minimum support
Association Rules	Extracts if-then rules from those itemsets
Support	            Frequency of itemset in all transactions
Confidence	        Strength of the rule (reliability)
Lift	            Indicates correlation (Lift > 1 = strong relationship)

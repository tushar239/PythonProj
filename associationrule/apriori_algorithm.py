Support	    P(A ∩ B)	How often A and B appear together
Confidence	P(B) when A appears = Support(A ∩ B) / Support(A)
Lift	    Confidence / Support(B)	    If Lift > 1, A and B are positively correlated

# Step 1: Import libraries
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori, association_rules
import pandas as pd

# Step 2: Sample transaction data (one-hot encoded)
# This DataFrame simulates 5 transactions with 4 items.
# Each row is a transaction; 1 = item bought, 0 = not bought
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'milk':   [1, 0, 1, 1, 0],

    'jam':    [0, 0, 1, 0, 1]

# Step 3: Find frequent itemsets
# min_support=0.4: Keep itemsets that appear in ≥ 40% of transactions
# use_colnames=True: Show item names instead of column indices
frequent_itemsets = apriori(df, min_support=0.4, use_colnames=True)

# Step 4: Generate rules
# metric="confidence": Filter rules by their reliability
# min_threshold=0.7: Only show rules with confidence ≥ 70%
rules = association_rules(frequent_itemsets, metric="confidence", min_threshold=0.7)

# Step 5: Show useful columns from the result

antecedents	    Items on the left-hand side of the rule (the "if" part)
consequents	    Items on the right-hand side (the "then" part)
support	        % of transactions that contain both sides
confidence	    Probability of consequents given antecedents (`P(B
lift	        How much more likely B is, given A, compared to random occurrence
'''

'''
Apriori	            Finds itemsets that meet a minimum support
Association Rules	Extracts if-then rules from those itemsets
Support	            Frequency of itemset in all transactions
Confidence	        Strength of the rule (reliability)
Lift	            Indicates correlation (Lift > 1 = strong relationship)

builins.py (builtins module)
----------
	In python module means a python file. you can import one python file into another.

	https://docs.python.org/3/library/builtins.html
	All builtin functions and vars are in builins.py. It is by default available to your modules. It is like java.lang.* in Java. You dont need to import it java, so as builtins in Python.


	1) builtins module's classes
	builtins module has classes also. 

	2) builtins module's methods
	https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#built-in-funcs

	Many buitins methods are actually classes
	e.g. slice, range, list, __generator, __function, __method, __coroutine, __namedtuple

	Many builtins methods are actually methods also
	e.g. sorted, abs, all, any, callable, compile, setattr, getattr, delattr, dir, eval, exec, exit, format, globals, locals, isinstance, issubclass, iter, len, max, min, open, pow, print, round, __import__, __build_class__, vars etc

	3) builtins module's constants
	https://docs.python.org/3/library/constants.html#built-in-consts

	object class is a base class in Python. It has many methods, but __new__ and __init__ are special.
	__new__ is static method that is used to instantiate a class. Normally, you don't override it in your class.
	__init__(self,...) is a method that is used to initialize instance variables. Normally, you override this method in your class.

	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/674304/pythons-use-of-new-and-init

	__new__ is the first step of instance creation. It's called first, and is responsible for returning a new instance of your class. In contrast, __init__ doesn't return anything; it's only responsible for initializing the instance after it's been created.
	In general, you shouldn't need to override __new__ unless you're subclassing an immutable type like str, int, unicode or tuple.



	4) Normally, you don't need to import builtins module in your module, but if you want you can do it to differentiate a call to your function and builtins module's function.
	e.g. this script has open function that needs to call builtins open.
		import builtins

		def open(path):
			f = builtins.open(path)

	You can also use __builitins__.open(path).

	Most modules have the name __builtins__ made available as part of their globals. The value of __builtins__ is normally either this module or the value of this module’s __dict__ attribute.


	5) NotImplemented constant and NotImplementedError class:
		https://dwieeb.com/2015/06/02/usages-of-notimplemented-and-notimplementederror-in-python/
		NotImplemented is a buitins module's constant.
		Normally, if you don't want client to access a method, then you raise an error (in Python, you raise NotImplementedError).
		But catching a raised error is very expensive, so Python has another alternative of returning NotImplemented from these kind of methods.
		NotImplemented is same as 'None (null)', but it is specially used for methods return value.
	
		class BaseClass:
			def foo(self):
				raise NotImplementedError


			class GoodChildClass(BaseClass):
				def foo(self):
					return 'bar'


			class BadChildClass(BaseClass):
				pass


		good = GoodChildClass()
		print(good.foo())  # bar
		bad = BadChildClass()
		print(bad.foo()) # NotImplemented
	
	
	6) object class:
		builtins module has an object class that is by default inherited by any class.
		object class has many methods that you can override in your class.
	
		def __delattr__(self, *args, **kwargs): # real signature unknown
		def __dir__(self): # real signature unknown; restored from __doc__
		def __eq__(self, *args, **kwargs): # real signature unknown
		def __format__(self, *args, **kwargs): # real signature unknown
		def __getattribute__(self, *args, **kwargs): # real signature unknown
		def __ge__(self, *args, **kwargs): # real signature unknown
		def __gt__(self, *args, **kwargs): # real signature unknown
		def __hash__(self, *args, **kwargs): # real signature unknown
		def __init__(self): # known special case of object.__init__
		def __le__(self, *args, **kwargs): # real signature unknown
		def __lt__(self, *args, **kwargs): # real signature unknown

		@staticmethod # known case of __new__
		def __new__(cls, *more): # known special case of object.__new__
		def __ne__(self, *args, **kwargs): # real signature unknown
		def __reduce_ex__(self, *args, **kwargs): # real signature unknown
		def __reduce__(self, *args, **kwargs): # real signature unknown
		def __repr__(self, *args, **kwargs): # real signature unknown
		def __setattr__(self, *args, **kwargs): # real signature unknown
		def __sizeof__(self): # real signature unknown; restored from __doc__
		def __str__(self, *args, **kwargs): # real signature unknown

		@classmethod # known case
		def __subclasshook__(cls, subclass): # known special case of object.__subclasshook__

	7) BaseException class and Chile Exception classes:
		builtins module has Exception classes also.
	
		It is like a Throwable class in Java. All exception classes extend this class.
			class BaseException(object):
	
	8) str, int, bool, bytearray, bytes, ..., complex class etc:
		i = int(x="10") # using int class to convert int or string to int
		print(type(i)) # <class 'int'>

		j = 10
		print(type(j)) # <class 'int'>
		print(i == j) # True

		IMP
		Unlike to Java, there is no difference between int class object and int literal in Python.


		what is complex(...) ???????????
		https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number
		https://docs.python.org/3.0/library/cmath.html
	
	9) staticmethod, classmethod, property class etc
	
		These classes are used as decorators(annotations) in Python.
	
		- You can use @staticmethod to declare a method as static inside a class.
		- You can use @classmethod on a method. This method takes 'cls' as a first parameter instead of 'self'
		- property decorator - property(fget=None, fset=None, fdel=None, doc=None)
				class C(object):
					@property
					def x(self):
						"I am the 'x' property."
						return self._x
				
					@x.setter
					def x(self, value):
						self._x = value
				
					@x.deleter
					def x(self):
						del self._x
	

__main__ and __module__
---------------------
	http://stackoverflow.com/questions/419163/what-does-if-name-main-do
	
	__module__ is a built-in property of any class.
	__main__ is a module name. Class.__module__ is assigned a module name when Python interpreter runs.
	if the python interpreter is running that module (the source file) as the main program, it sets the special __module__ variable to have a value "__main__". 
	If this file is being imported from another module, __module__ will be set to the module's name.

	def fun():
		...
	
	if __name__ == "__main__":  # This condition acts like 'main()' in java    
		...
			
Attributes
----------
	variables and functions are called attributes in Python.

Varargs
-------
	http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2008/01/how-to-use-args-and-kwargs-in-python/

	The special syntax, *args and **kwargs in function definitions is used to pass a variable number of arguments to a function. 
	The single asterisk form (*args) is used to pass a non-keyworded (tuple, list, set etc), variable-length argument list, 
	and 
	The double asterisk form is used to pass a keyworded (key-value pairs), variable-length argument list.


	# testing *args: parameter with * is considered as tuple (varargs)
	def test_var_args(farg, *args):
		print("formal arg:", farg)
		for element in args: # args is a tuple
			print("args element: "+element)


	# testing **kwargs: parameter with ** is considered as dictionary(map)
	# you pass it is a test_var_kwargs(1, myarg2="two", myarg3=3)
	def test_var_kwargs(farg, **kwargs):
		print("formal arg:", farg)
		for key in kwargs: # kwargs is a dictionary(map)
			print("another keyword arg: %s: %s" % (key, kwargs[key]))


	# Passing both args and kwargs together
	def test_var_args_kwargs_together(*args, **kwargs):
		print(args)
		print(kwargs)


	# You can actually pass arguments as a tuple
	# args=(...)
	# test_var_args_call(*args)
	def test_var_args_call(arg1, arg2, arg3):
		print("arg1:", arg1)
		print("arg2:", arg2)
		print("arg3:", arg3)


	# You can actually pass arguments as a dictionary(map)
	# kwargs={"fn":"...","ln":"...","age":...},
	# test_var_kwargs_call(**kwargs)
	def test_var_kwargs_call(fn, ln, age):
		print("fn:", fn)
		print("ln:", ln)
		print("age:", age)

	args=("hi", "I", "am")
	kwargs={"fn":"Tushar", "ln":"Chokshi", "age":26}

	test_var_args_call(*args) # same as test_var_args_call("hi", "I", "am")
	test_var_kwargs_call(**kwargs) # same as test_var_args_call("fn":"Tushar", "ln":"Chokshi", "age":26)
	test_var_args_kwargs_together(*args, **kwargs) # same as test_var_args_call("hi", "I", "am", "fn":"Tushar", "ln":"Chokshi", "age":26)

	test_var_args(1, "hi", "I", "am")
	test_var_kwargs(1, myarg2="two", myarg3=3)


	Another Example:-

	def func(required_arg, *args, **kwargs):
		# required_arg is a positional-only parameter.
		print(required_arg)

		# args is a tuple of positional arguments,
		# because the parameter name has * prepended.
		if args: # If args is not empty.
			print(args)

		# kwargs is a dictionary of keyword arguments,
		# because the parameter name has ** prepended.
		if kwargs: # If kwargs is not empty.
			print(kwargs)

	func("required argument")
	# O/P: required argument
	func("required argument", 1, 2, '3')
	# O/P:
	# required argument
	# (1, 2, '3')
	func("required argument", 1, 2, '3', hi=4, hello="foo")
	# O/P:
	# required argument
	# (1, 2, '3')
	# {'hi': 'foo', 'hello': 4}

print statement
---------------
	syntax of print is 'def print(*args, sep=' ', end='\n', file=None)'
	*args is same as java varargs

	print "Jai Guru Dev"

	In Python, you can send the parameters in any order as long as you provide a parameter name
	print("Tushar", "Chokshi", sep="$", end="\n")
	O/P: Tushar$Chokshi

	# This is same as String.format() in java
	print("Value of static var is %d and value of name var is %s " % (Parent.get_static_var(), parent.get_name()))

	printing in separate new line

		for i in [1,2,3,4,5]
			print i 		# this will print in new line. Same as System.out.println() in java
	
		O/P:
		1
		2
		3
		4
		5

	printing in one line

		for i in [1,2,3,4,5]:
			print(i, end=" ") # 1 2 3 4 5

comments
--------
	single line comment
	# something

	multi-line comment : it is surrounded by 3 single quotes
	'''
	something
	'''

	OR		: it is surrounded by 3 double quotes
	
	"""
	something
	"""

	3 single/double quotes are also used for documentation string(docstring), but if your contents are not docstring then Python considers it as a comment.

Variables
---------
	No type for the variables

	Assignment : 
		You can reassign a value to a variable with different type
	Type Casting (Type Conversion): 
		To change the variable from one type to another, int(var), float(var), str(var) etc inbuilt functions are there
		Unlike to Java, you cannot concatenate non-string with string. You need to use str(var) function
	Undefined Vars:
		Unlike to Javascript, you cannot have undefined variables. It will throw error
	Arithmetic operations:
		you can use +, -, *, %, /
		In addition Python has the power (**) --- NEW
	Equality Comparison: 
		Use == operator to compare any two variables (string or non-string). Cannot compare vars of two different types.
	Chained Comparison: --- NEW
		one < two < three
		

	# Assignment
	a = b = 2  # This is called a "chained assignment"
	greetings = "greetings"
	print ("greetings:"+ greetings)

	greetings=10 
	print ("greetings:"+ str(greetings))

	# Type Conversion
	# IMP - Unlike to Java, you cannot concatenate non-string with string. You need to use builtins module's class str(var).
	float_num = 10.0
	#print("str:"+ float_num)   # doesnt work - you cannot concatenate flat with string
	print("str:"+ str(float_num))


	# Undefined Variable
	variable = 1
	#print(otherVar) # NameError: name 'otherVar' is not defined

	# Arithmetic Operations
	number = 9.0       
	#result = number/0 # ZeroDivisionError: float division
	result = number/2
	remainder = number%2

	print("result = " + str(result)) # 4.5
	print("remainder = " + str(remainder)) # 1.0

	print(2**3) # it is same as 2*2*2

	# Equality Comparison
	f1=1.0
	s="1.0"
	f2=1.0

	print("comparing float and string: "+str(f1==s)) # False
	print("comparing float and float: "+str(f1==f2)) # True

	# Chained Comparison
	one = 1
	two = 2
	three = 3

	 # This chained comparison means that the (one < two) and (two < three) comparisons are performed at the same time.
	print(one < two < three) # True

	is_greater = three < two
	print(is_greater) # False

None(null) Variable
-------------------
	To initialize any variable as null in Python, there is a keyword 'None' available.

	firstName=None # initializing a var as null
	firstName="Tushar"

Strings
-------
	Concatenation
		Using + operator, you can concatenate strings
	
	Multiplication: ----- NEW
		print("hello" * 10) will print "hello" ten times
	
	Indexing --- NEW
		You can use String like an array of characters to get any character out of it.
	
		Positive Indexing		
			str="hello"   print(str[2])	will print a char 'l'.
			It is same as charAt(index) function of java.
		Negative Indexing
			You can use -ve numbers to read a string backwards
			str="hello"   print(str[-1])	will print a char 'o'.	
		
	Slicing (substring)
		monty_python = "Monty Python"
		print(monty_python[:5])  # Monty    # one or both index could be dropped. monty_python[:5] is equal to monty_python[0:5]
		print(monty_python[1:3]) # on
	
	in Operator (contains)
		print ("ll" in "hello") # True
		print ("el" not in "hello") # False
	
	length function --- NEW
		len is a function in Python. It is not a method of string object. You cannot do "hello".len(). You have to do len("hello")
		print(len("hello")) #5
	
	Formatting
		http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_strings.htm
		Just like String.format("hi %d", 9) in java
		print "My name is %s and weight is %d kg!" % ('Zara', 21) # My name is Zara and weight is 21 kg!

	Triple Quotes --- NEW
		http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_strings.htm
		Python's triple quotes comes to the rescue by allowing strings to span multiple lines, including verbatim NEWLINEs, TABs, and any other special characters.
	
		para_str = """this is a long string that is made up of
					several lines and non-printable characters such as
					TAB ( \t ) and they will show up that way when displayed.
					NEWLINEs within the string, whether explicitly given like
					this within the brackets [ \n ], or just a NEWLINE within
					the variable assignment will also show up.
					"""
		print para_str	
	
		O/P:
			this is a long string that is made up of
			several lines and non-printable characters such as
			TAB (    ) and they will show up that way when displayed.
			NEWLINEs within the string, whether explicitly given like
			this within the brackets [
			 ], or just a NEWLINE within
			the variable assignment will also show up.

	Escaping
		print('"\'hi\'"') # "'hi'"	

	Ignoring escape --- NEW
		Raw strings do not treat the backslash as a special character at all. Every character you put into a raw string stays the way you wrote it 
		print 'C:\\nowhere'  # C:\nowhere
		print r'C:\\nowhere' # C:\\nowhere	--- prefix r allows to consider a string as a row string. It ignores escape characters.
	
		print 'hi \t how r u'  # 'hi		how r u'	
		print r'hi \t how r u' # 'hi \t how r u'
		
	Unicode String --- NEW
		http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_strings.htm
		Normal strings in Python are stored internally as 8-bit ASCII, while Unicode strings are stored as 16-bit Unicode. This allows for a more varied set of characters, including special characters from most languages in the world.
	
		print u'Hello, world!' --- prefix u allows a string having UTF-8 charsets

	Methods
		http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_strings.htm

Data Structures
---------------
	http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_lists.htm
	http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_tuples.htm
	http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_dictionary.htm

	https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html

	Python has data structures like 
		List - can be used to create Set, Stack, Queue, Tuple
		Tuple --- immutable
		Dictionary (Map) --- like Java map. keys should be immutable. It means that along with String, int etc, you can also use Tuple.

	List -
		In Python, List is nothing but an resizable array.  --- NEW
		Unlike to Java, you don't have to create an instance of a List.
	
		Lists might contain items of different types, but usually all the items in the list are of the same type. 
		Like strings, lists can be indexed and sliced
		Tuple can be converted to a list using a function list(tuple)

		squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]   # create new list
		print(squares)	# [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
		print(squares[:3]) # [1, 4, 9]
	
		List Functions
			http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_lists.htm
			cmp(list1, list2)
			Compares elements of both lists. Return -1 / 0 / 1.
			list1==list2 returns True/False

			len(list)
			Gives the total length of the list.

			max(list)
			Returns item from the list with max value.

			min(list)
			Returns item from the list with min value.

			list(seq)
			Converts a tuple into list.
	
		List Operations
			http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_lists.htm
			- Concatenating two lists  - use list1 += list2
			- Repetition - use list=list*4     ----- NEW
			- Adding new element - use list.append(element)
			- Changing the element - use list[index]=element
			- Removing an element 
				- use list[index]=[]  or use list[start:end]=[]
				- use list.remove(obj)
				- use del operator  -  del list[index]
			- Indexing - use list[index] to retrieve an element from a particular index in the list
			- Slicing - it is same retrieving java sublist. use list[start:end] or list[:end] same as list[0:end] or list[start:] same as list[start:len(list)]
			- Clearing - clearing is same as removing all elements. list[0:len(list)]=[]
			- In/not in operator (contains) = 3 in [1,2,3] returns True , 4 not in [1,2,3] returns false
			- Iteration - 
				for x in [1, 2, 3]: 
					print x			# There are no braces like Java. So indentation is important in Python.
				
	
			animals = ['elephant', 'lion', 'tiger', "giraffe"]  # create new list
			print(animals) 										# ['elephant', 'lion', 'tiger', "giraffe"] 

			animals += ["monkey", 'dog']    # add two items to the list
			print(animals) 					# ['elephant', 'lion', 'tiger', 'giraffe', 'monkey', 'dog']

			animals.append("dino")   # add one more item to the list using append() method
			print(animals) 			 # ['elephant', 'lion', 'tiger', 'giraffe', 'monkey', 'dog', 'dino']

			animals[len(animals)-1] = "dinasauras"
			print(animals) 			 # ['elephant', 'lion', 'tiger', 'giraffe', 'monkey', 'dog', 'dinasauras']

			print(animals[1:3])		 # ['lion', 'tiger']

			animals[1:3]=[]   	 	 #  Removing a few elements
			print(animals)			 # ['elephant', 'giraffe', 'monkey', 'dog', 'dinasauras']

			animals=animals*2		 # Repetition			
			print(animals)			 # ['elephant', 'giraffe', 'monkey', 'dog', 'dinasauras', 'elephant', 'giraffe', 'monkey', 'dog', 'dinasauras']	
		
			print('elephant' in animals) # True
		
			animals[:len(animals)]=[] #  Clearing a list
			print(animals)			 # []

			del animals				 # animals become undefined
			# print(animals) # NameError: name 'animals' is not defined




	
			list.append(obj)
			Appends object obj to list
	
			list.count(obj)
			Returns count of how many times obj occurs in list
	
			list.extend(seq)
			Appends the contents of seq to list
	
			list.index(obj)
			Returns the lowest index in list that obj appears

			list.insert(index, obj)
			Inserts object obj into list at offset index

			list.pop(obj=list[-1])
			Removes and returns last object or obj from list
	
			list.remove(obj)
			Removes object obj from list
	
			list.reverse()
			Reverses objects of list in place
	
			list.sort([func])
			Sorts objects of list, use compare func if given

	Tuples -
		Tuples are almost same as List. The only difference is they are unmodifiable once created. You cannot add/delete/change anything in a tuple.
		Tuple is enclosed within (). List is enclosed within []
	
		Creating a tuple is as simple as putting different comma-separated values. Optionally you can put these comma-separated values between parentheses also. For example −

		tup1 = ('physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000);
		tup2 = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 );
		tup3 = "a", "b", "c", "d";
	
		The empty tuple is written as two parentheses containing nothing −
		tup1 = ();
	
		To write a tuple containing a single value you have to include a comma, even though there is only one value −
		tup1 = (50,);
	
		Like string indices, tuple indices start at 0, and they can be sliced, concatenated, and so on.
	
		tup=(1,2,'abc')
		for x in tup:      # There are no braces like Java. So indentation is important in Python
			print x
		
		del tup;
		#print tup; # NameError: name 'tup' is not defined

	Dictionaries -
		It is just like a Map in Java.
		Just like Lists, Tuples and Strings, you can use 'in' operator 
		You can use 'del' operator to remove key-value
		Keys must be immutable. ------ NEW
			Which means you can use strings, numbers or tuples as dictionary keys but something like ['key'] is not allowed. 
	
		phone_book = {"John": 123, "Jane": 234, "Jerard": 345}    # "John", "Jane" and "Jerard" are keys and numbers are values
		print(phone_book)

		# Add new item to the dictionary
		phone_book["Jill"] = 456
		print(phone_book)   

		# Remove key-value pair from phone_book
		del phone_book['John']

		print(phone_book.keys()) # ['Jane', 'Jill', 'Jerard']
		print(phone_book.values()) # [234, 456, 345]
	
		print('Jane' in phone_book) # in operator
	
		phone_book.clear();     # remove all entries in dict
		print(phone_book)		# {}
	
		del phone_book ;        # delete entire dictionary
		# print(phone_book)		# NameError: name 'grocery_dict' is not defined
	
		# Keys must be immutable. Which means you can use strings, numbers or tuples as dictionary keys but something like ['key'] is not allowed. 
		# Following is a simple example:
		dict = {['Name']: 'Zara', 'Age': 7}
		# print "dict['Name']: ", dict['Name'] # TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'
	
		# You can use tuples as keys because they are immutable.
		dict = {('Name'): 'Zara', 'Age': 7}
		print "dict['Name']: ", dict[('Name')]
	
		http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_dictionary.htm
		Functions
	
			cmp(dict1, dict2)
			Compares elements of both dict.

			len(dict)
			Gives the total length of the dictionary. This would be equal to the number of items in the dictionary.

			str(dict)
			Produces a printable string representation of a dictionary

			type(variable)
			Returns the type of the passed variable. If passed variable is dictionary, then it would return a dictionary type.
	
		Operations
	
		dict.clear()
		Removes all elements of dictionary dict
	
		dict.copy()
		Returns a shallow copy of dictionary dict

		dict.fromkeys()
		Create a new dictionary with keys from seq and values set to value.

		dict.get(key, default=None)
		For key key, returns value or default if key not in dictionary

		dict.has_key(key)
		Returns true if key in dictionary dict, false otherwise

		dict.items()
		Returns a list of dict's (key, value) tuple pairs. Converts {key1=value1, key2...} to [(key1,value1), (key2,value2), ...]

		dict.keys()
		Returns list of dictionary dict's keys

		dict.setdefault(key, default=None)
		Similar to get(), but will set dict[key]=default if key is not already in dict

		dict.update(dict2)
		Adds dictionary dict2's key-values pairs to dict

		dict.values()
		Returns list of dictionary dict's values

	Set, Stack, Queue
		https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html
	
		List is used to create a Set, Stack or Queue
	
		# list provides pop(). so, it can be used as a stack
		list = [3,4,5,4]
		list.append(6)
		list.pop() # list provides pop(). So It acts as a stack's pop()
		print("list: "+str(list)) # [3, 4, 5, 4]
		print([i for i in list]) # [3, 4, 5, 4] - one liner for loop (comprehensive loop)

		# list as a set
		# Note: to create an empty set you have to use set(), not {}; the latter creates an empty dictionary
		mySet = set(list) # use set(list) to convert a list to set
		print("set: "+str(mySet)) # {3, 4, 5}
		for i in mySet:
			print(i, end=" ") # 3 4 5
		print()

		# list as a queue
		# To implement a queue, use collections.deque which was designed to have fast appends and pops from both ends.
		myQueue = collections.deque(list) # use collections.deque(list) to convert a list to queue
		myQueue.pop()
		myQueue.popleft()
		print("queue: "+ str(myQueue)) # deque([4, 5])
		for i in myQueue:
			print(i, end=" ") # 4 5
		print()
	
		# list as a tuple
		t = tuple(list)
		print(t) # [3,4,5,4]

Comprehensions of List (writing a loop in one line)
----------------------
	https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html#list-comprehensions
	
	You can write a for loop in one line. Even nested for loop with if condition. This kind of comprehension returns a list.
	
	list=[3, 4, 5, 4]
	print([i for i in list]) # [3, 4, 5, 4] - one liner for loop (comprehensive loop)
	
	# nested for loops with if condition
	list1 = [1,2,3,4]
	list2 = [4,5]
	result = [(i,j) for i in list1 for j in list2 if i!=j]
	print(result) # [(1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 5)]
	
Condition Expressions
---------------------
	equals (==), not equals (!=), and (and), or (or), not (not)
	
		Boolean operators are not evaluated from left to right. 
		There's an order of operations for boolean operators: 
			"not" is evaluated first, 
			"and" is evaluated next, 
			"or" is evaluated last.
	
		name = "John"
		age = 17

		print(name == "John" or age == 17) # True   # checks that either name equals to "John" OR age equals to 17
		print(name == "John" and age != 23) # True
		print (name == "John" and not age == 23) # True

		print(name == "John" or not age > 17) # True
		print(name == "Ellis" or not (name == "John" and age == 17)) # False
	
		file = open("readwritefile.txt","r+",1);
		if(not file.closed): # instead of using if(file.closed == False), use if(not file.closed)
			print("Reading the file\n")
			print(file.read())
			file.close()

	if condition
	
		- If the suite of an if clause consists only of a single line, it may go on the same line as the header statement.
	
		var = 100
		if ( var  == 100 ) : print "Value of expression is 100"
		print "Good bye!"
	
	
		- If the suite of an if clause consists of multiple lines, indentation is very important as there are no {} like Java.
	
		name = "John"
		age = 17

		if (name == "John" or age == 17):   # check that name is "John" or age is 17. If so print next 2 lines.
			print("name is John")
			print("John is 17 years old")

		tasks = ['task1', 'task2']    # create new list

		- if-else block
	
		if (tasks == []):
			print("empty")
		else:
			print("not empty")
	
		- nested if block
	
		if expression1:
		   statement(s)
		   if expression2:
			  statement(s)
		   elif expression3:
			  statement(s)
		   else:
			  statement(s)
		elif expression4:
		   statement(s)
		else:
		   statement(s)
	
Loops
-----
	For loop
		# Iterating a list given by a range
		for i in range(5):    # range(5) function returns list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
			print(i)          


		# Iterating a list
		primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]   # create new list
		for prime in primes:
			print(prime)

		# Iterating a Tuple
		tuple1=(1,2,3,"hi",4,5,6)
		for i in tuple1:
			print(i)

		# Iterating a String ----- NEW
		# Strings are very similar to list in Python. So, you can iterate a String just like a list
		for char in hello_world:
			print char
		
	While loop
		while expression:
		   statement(s)
   
		Infinite while loop
			b = True
			while(b):
				print("hi")   

	break statement
		zoo = ["lion", 'tiger', 'elephant']
		while True:                         # this condition cannot possibly be false
			animal = zoo.pop()       # extract one element from the list end
			print(animal)
			if animal == 'elephant':
				break           # exit loop

	continue statement
		for x in range(10):
			if x%2 == 0:   # If x is an even number
				continue   # skip print(x) for this loop
			print(x)

	pass statement ------ NEW
		http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_pass_statement.htm
		The pass statement is a null operation; nothing happens when it executes. The pass is also useful in places where your code will eventually go, but has not been written yet (e.g., in stubs for example):

		for letter in 'Python': 
		   if letter == 'h':
			  pass			# nothing happens. It is a placeholder for future statements.
			  print 'This is pass block'
		   print 'Current Letter :', letter
	   
		   O/P:
			Current Letter : P
			Current Letter : y
			Current Letter : t
			This is pass block
			Current Letter : h
			Current Letter : o
			Current Letter : n	
		
Methods
---------
	https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#other-built-in-types

	There are two types of Methods - 
		UnBound 
		Bound (instance method)

	Every instance method (Bound Method) has two specials attributes:
		1) __self__ attribute stores the reference of a class instance.
		2) __func__ attribute is the function implementing the method.
			Calling m(arg-1, arg-2, ..., arg-n) is completely equivalent to calling m.__func__(m.__self__, arg-1, arg-2, ..., arg-n).
			You can add attributes to __func__ like method.__func__.hi = "hi"

	class C:
		def method(self, name):
			"I am a method"
			self.name=name
			print(name)
			pass
		def method1(self):
			print("Inside method1")

		c=C()
		print(type(c)) # <class '__main__.C'>
		c.method("Tushar")
		print(type(c.name)) # <class 'str'>

		print(c.method.__self__) # <__main__.C object at 0x1005a5e48>
		c1 = c.method.__self__
		c1.method1() # Inside method1

		print(c.method.__func__) # <function C.method at 0x1023f0158>
		print(c.method.__func__(c.method.__self__,"Tushar"))

		print(c.method.__str__()) # <bound method C.method of <__main__.C object at 0x102078908>>
		print(c.method.__module__) # __main__

		#c.method.whoami  = 'my name is method'  # can't set on the method
		c.method.__func__.whoami = 'my name is method'
		c.method.__func__.hi = "hi"
		print(c.method.__func__.whoami) # my name is method
		print(c.method.__func__.hi) # hi
	
	Class attributes can be referenced
		https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html
	
		m1=c.method1
		m1() # Inside method1

	

	http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_functions.htm
	
	You can call a function by using the following types of formal arguments:

		- Required arguments
	
				Required arguments are the arguments passed to a function in correct positional order.
			
				def foo(x):                 # x is a function parameter
					print("x = " + str(x))

				foo(5)   # pass 5 to foo(). Here 5 is an argument passed to function foo.


				def fun(myList):
					for i in myList:
						print i,

				list = [1,2,3]
				fun(list) 		# 1 2 3
			
		- Keyword arguments
	
				Keyword arguments are related to the function calls. When you use keyword arguments in a function call, the caller identifies the arguments by the parameter name.
				This allows you to skip arguments or place them out of order because the Python interpreter is able to use the keywords provided to match the values with parameters. 
			
				def printinfo( name, age ):
				   "This prints a passed info into this function"
				   print "Name: ", name
				   print "Age ", age
				   return;

				# Now you can call printinfo function
				printinfo( age=50, name="miki" )
						O/P:
						Name:  miki
						Age  50
					
		- Default arguments
	
				def printinfo( name, age = 35 ):
				   "This prints a passed info into this function"
				   print "Name: ", name
				   print "Age ", age
				   return;

				# Now you can call printinfo function
				printinfo( age=50, name="miki" )
				printinfo( name="miki" )
			
	return statement-

		list = [1,2] --- global variable

		def fun(a, b):
			list = [a,b]   --- function's local variable. It is not global 'list' variable.
			return list

		list2=fun(3,4)  
		print(list2) --- [3,4]
		print(list) --- [1,2]
	
	Accessing outside variables from a function
	
		To access outside variables from a function, you need to use a keyword 'global', otherwise Python will consider as a local variable.
	
		firstName = None # None is same as null in java
		lastName = None

		def set_name(fName, lName=None): # default value of lName is 'None', which is same as null in java
			global firstName	# To access global variable firstName, you need to declare it as global inside the function
			global lastName	
			firstName=fName
			lastName=lName
	
		def get_name():
			return firstName+" "+lastName    

		set_name("Tushar", "Chokshi")
		print(get_name()) # Tushar Chokshi

	Accessing globals and locals members

		If locals() is called from within a function, it will return all the names that can be accessed locally from that function.
		If globals() is called from within a function, it will return all the names that can be accessed globally from that function.
		The return type of both these functions is dictionary.
	
		firstName = None
		lastName = None

		def set_name(fName, lName=None):
			locals()	# {'lastName': 'Chokshi', 'firstName': 'Tushar', 'fName': 'Tushar', 'lName': 'Chokshi'}
			globals()   # {'lastName': None, 'set_name': <function set_name at 0x10207b8c8>, '__package__': None, '__builtins__': <module 'builtins' (built-in)>, '__spec__': None, '__name__': '__main__', 'firstName': None, '__doc__': None, '__cached__': None, '__loader__': <_frozen_importlib_external.SourceFileLoader object at 0x1005a5cf8>, 'get_name': <function get_name at 0x10207b950>, '__file__': '/Users/chokst/MavenizedProjectEclipseWSNew/PythonProject/globalslocals/globalslocals.py'}


	Assigning a function to a variable (just like javascript)	

		class MyCalendar:
			def get_calendar(self):
				return calendar.month(2016, 1) # displays a calendar fo January 2016

		myCalendar = MyCalendar()
		getCalendarMethodVar = myCalendar.get_calendar # binding a function to a variable (just like javascript)
		print(getCalendarMethodVar())


Lambda (anonymous) functions
----------------------------
	http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_functions.htm

	The syntax of lambda functions contains only a single statement, which is as follows −
		lambda [arg1 [,arg2,.....argn]]:expression

		# Function definition is here
		sum = lambda arg1, arg2: arg1 + arg2;

		# Now you can call sum as a function
		print "Value of total : ", sum( 10, 20 )
		print "Value of total : ", sum( 20, 20 )

	map, filter and reduce functions
		http://www.python-course.eu/lambda.php
		
		These functions takes either a function or lambda as a parameter.
		lambda internally creates a function only, but it is a compact code. 

		map function-
			The advantage of the lambda operator can be seen when it is used in combination with the map() function. 
	
			map() is a function with two arguments:
				r = map(func, seq)
	
			The first argument func is the name of a function and the second a sequence (e.g. a list) seq. 
			map() applies the function func to all the elements of the sequence seq. 
			It returns a new list with the elements changed by func

			e.g. map taking function as an argument
				def fahrenheit(T):
					print T
					return ((float(9)/5)*T + 32)

				temp = (36.5, 37, 37.5,39)

				F = map(fahrenheit, temp) # map takes a list/tuple as an argument. It sends an element of list/tuple one by one to a function/lambda (here fahrenheit function) and collects the ouptut in a list and returns that list
				print F # [97.700000000000003, 98.600000000000009, 99.5, 102.2]

			e.g. map taking lambda as an argument
			map() can be applied to more than one list. The lists have to have the same length.
	
			a = [1,2,3,4]
			b = [17,12,11,10]
			print map(lambda x,y: x+y, a,b)	--- this lambda implicitly creates a function having x,y as parameters and 'return x+y' as body. map sends a value of lists a and b one by one to this function.

		filter function-
			The function filter(function, list) offers an elegant way to filter out all the elements of a list, for which the function function returns True. 
			The function filter(f,l) needs a function f as its first argument. f returns a Boolean value, i.e. either True or False. This function will be applied to every element of the list l. 
			Only if f returns True will the element of the list be included in the result list.
	
			fib = [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55]
			result = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, fib)
			print result # [0, 2, 8, 34]

		reduce function-
			The function reduce(func, seq) continually applies the function func() to the sequence seq. It returns a single value. 

			If seq = [ s1, s2, s3, ... , sn ], calling reduce(func, seq) works like this:
	
				- At first the first two elements of seq will be applied to func, i.e. func(s1,s2) The list on which reduce() works looks now like this: [ func(s1, s2), s3, ... , sn ]
				- In the next step func will be applied on the previous result and the third element of the list, i.e. func(func(s1, s2),s3)
					The list looks like this now: [ func(func(s1, s2),s3), ... , sn ]
				- Continue like this until just one element is left and return this element as the result of reduce()

	
			reduce(lambda x,y: x+y, [47,11,42,13])  # 113
				47+11=58
				58+42=100
				100+13=113
	
			f = lambda a,b: a if (a > b) else b
			reduce(f, [47,11,42,102,13]) # 102
	
			reduce(lambda x, y: x+y, range(1,101)) # 5050
	
Classes and Objects
-------------------
	_ __new__(...) method and initialization method __init__(self,...)
		object class is a base class in Python. It has many methods, but __new__ and __init__ are special.
		__new__ is a static method that is used to instantiate a class. Normally, you don't override it in your class.
		__init__(self,...) is a method that is used to initialize instance variables. Normally, you override this method in your class.
	
	- Initialization Method (__init__(self,...)) Overloading: 
		You cannot overload any method or constructor in Python. It is actually trivial to mimic methdo overloading by passing mentioning optional parameters with default values.
	
	- Static Methods: 
		Methods can be defined static using @staticmethod. static method may or may not take 'self' as an argument. If it takes then you need to pass instance variable as an argument when you call it.
	
	- Types of variables in a class:
		Two types of variables: class and instance
		- class variables are same as static variables in Java. They can be accessed using ClassName.var or classInstance.var
	
	- Self: 
		Every method (except static methods) in a class has first parameter as 'self'. self is same as 'this' in java.
	
	- Adding more class/instance variables:
		Unlike to java, you can add class/instance variable any time (inside a class or outside a class)
	
	- There are methods like
		-    getattr(obj, name, [default value])
		-    setattr(obj, name, value)
		-    hasattr(obj, name)
		-    delattr(obj, name)
	
	- Private Variable and Method: 
		private variable/method is defined with a prefix '__'.	Private variable/method cannot be accessed from outside the class.
		e.g. __privateVar, __get_private_var(self)

	class Calculator:
		current = 0 # Class Variable is like a static variable

		# def __init__(self): # __init__ method is an implicit method for every class. It acts as a construct/initialization method.
		#    self.number = 10

		def __init__(self, number): # Unlike to Java, you cannot have overloaded constructors
			self.number = number
			self.amount = 0
			self.__privateVar = 10 # Private variable is prefixed with '__'. Private variable cannot be accessed from outside the class

		def add(self, amount, number=10):
			self.amount = amount
			self.number=number
			Calculator.current += amount # class variables are accessed like ClassName.var or classObj.var

		# Method overloading is not possible in Python
		# it is actually trivial to mimic overloading in Python by setting method args with default values
		# def add(self, amt): # As no instance variable is used inside this method, tool advices you to make it static, but it is not mandatory
		#    return amt+10

		@staticmethod # This is how you can define method as static
		def static_method1(self):
			self.number=60
			return 10

		@staticmethod # You can use decorator @classmethod also
		def static_method2(): # static method do not need to have 'self' as an argument
			return 10


		def get_amount(self): # Every method takes self as first parameter. You don't have pass self while calling a method.
			return self.amount # using self is mandatory to access instance variables

		def get_current(self): # Unlike to Java, preferred way of naming a method is keeping all lower case
			return self.current

		def get_number(self):
			return self.number
		
		def __private_method(self): # Private method starts with '__' prefix 
			return self.__privateVar;


	calc1 = Calculator(0) # no need of data type in Python. No need of 'new' operator

	calc1.add(10)

	print("number: " + str(calc1.get_number())) # 10
	print("current: " + str(Calculator.current)) # 10
	print("current: " + str(calc1.current)) # 10
	print("current: " + str(calc1.get_current())) # 10
	print("amount: " + str(calc1.get_amount())) # 10
	# print("privateVar: "+str(calc1.__priavateVar)) # Private variable cannot be accessed from outside the class. 'Calculator' object has no attribute '__priavateVar'
	# print("calling private method: "+str(calc1.__private_method())) # Private method cannot be accessed from outside the class.

	print("has current attr: " + str(hasattr(calc1, "current"))) # True
	print("has amount attr: " + str(hasattr(calc1, "amount"))) # True
	print("has anotherAmount attr: " + str(hasattr(calc1, "anotherAmount"))) # False
	print("get anotherAmount attr that does not exist: " + str(getattr(calc1, "anotherAmount", 30))) # 30 - If variable does not exist, then return some value instead of throwing an error
	print("has anotherAmount attr: " + str(hasattr(calc1, "anotherAmount"))) # False

	# Adding class variable whenever required
	Calculator.otherCurrent = 10
	# Adding instance variable whenever required
	calc1.otherAmount = 20
	print("otherCurrent: " + str(Calculator.otherCurrent)) # 10
	print("otherAmount: " + str(calc1.otherAmount)) # 20

	print("Calling static method1: "+str(Calculator.static_method1(calc1))) # 10
	print("number: " + str(calc1.number)) # 60
	print("Calling static method2: "+str(Calculator.static_method2())) # 10

Class Built-in Attributes
-------------------------
	__dict__: Dictionary containing the class's namespace.
	__doc__: Class documentation string or none, if undefined.
	__name__: Class name.
	__module__: Module name in which the class is defined. This attribute is "__main__" in interactive mode.
				__name__ is a built-in property of any class.
				__main__ is a module name. Class.__module__ is assigned a module name when Python interpreter runs.
				if the python interpreter is running that module (the source file) as the main program, it sets the special __name__ variable to have a value "__main__". 
				If this file is being imported from another module, __module__ will be set to the module's name.
	__bases__: A possibly empty tuple containing the base classes, in the order of their occurrence in the base class list.

Garbage Collection
------------------
	http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_classes_objects.htm

	Python deletes unneeded objects (built-in types or class instances) automatically to free the memory space.

Modules and Packages
--------------------
	http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_modules.htm

	In Python, file names are same modules and a directory of these modules is called a package.
	Each of these modules can have classes or functions that can be imported and used by client script
	There are two ways to import modules
		1. create __init__.py in a package and import all modules there and import just a package in client script
		2. import all modules directly in client script

	https://docs.python.org/3/reference/import.html#packages
	parent/
		__init__.py
		one/
			__init__.py
		two/
			__init__.py
		three/
			__init__.py
		
	A regular package is typically implemented as a directory containing an __init__.py file. 
	When a regular package is imported, this __init__.py file is implicitly executed, and the objects it defines are bound to names in the package’s namespace. 
	The __init__.py file can contain the same Python code that any other module can contain, and Python will add some additional attributes to the module when it is imported.        

	Importing parent.one will implicitly execute parent/__init__.py and parent/one/__init__.py. Subsequent imports of parent.two or parent.three will execute parent/two/__init__.py and parent/three/__init__.py respectively.

	These are multiple ways you can import the modules.

		1) import modulename.classname --- if you use this approach, then you need to use modulename.classname()
		2) from modname import classname1[, classname2[, ... classnameN]] --- if you use this approach, then you can use classname()
		3) from modname import * --- if you use this approach, then you can use classname()	
		4) importlib.import_module(moduleName) or 
		5) __import__(modulename)


	Locating Modules:

		When you import a module, the Python interpreter searches for the module in the following sequences −

		- The current directory.
		- If the module isn't found, Python then searches each directory in the shell variable PYTHONPATH.
		- If all else fails, Python checks the default path. On UNIX, this default path is normally /usr/local/lib/python/.

		The module search path is stored in the system module sys as the sys.path variable.
		The sys.path variable contains the current directory, PYTHONPATH, and the installation-dependent default.

		The PYTHONPATH is an environment variable, consisting of a list of directories.
		The syntax of PYTHONPATH is the same as that of the shell variable PATH.

		Here is a typical PYTHONPATH from a Windows system:

		set PYTHONPATH=c:\python20\lib;
		And here is a typical PYTHONPATH from a UNIX system:

		set PYTHONPATH=/usr/local/lib/python

	create packagesandmodules.Phone package(directory)
		G3.py
	
			def g3():
				print("I'm G3 Phone")

			def anotherG3():
				print("I'm anotherG3 Phone")

		G4.py
			class G4:
				def get_g4(self):
					print("I'm G4 Phone")	
	
		Isdn.py
			def isdn():
				print("I'm Isdn Phone")	
	
		Pots.py
			def pots():
				print("I'm Pots Phone")			
	
		__init__.py		-------------- IMP
			from packagesandmodules.Phone.Pots import pots
			from packagesandmodules.Phone.Isdn import isdn
			from packagesandmodules.Phone.G3 import g3, anotherG3 # G3, anotherG3 are functions
			from packagesandmodules.Phone.G4 import G4 # G4 is a class	    

	Create these to class files under 'packagesandmodules.library' package.

					self.color = color

	Reloading a module (reload(module) function)
		http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_modules.htm
	
		Let's say you have imported some module in your script. You script is running and there is a possibility that while your script is running, imported module's script can change.
		So, in this case, you need to reload imported module in your script in between.
	
		import foo

		while True:
			# Do some things.
			if is_changed(foo):
				foo = reload(foo)

File Input/Output and Directories
---------------------------------
	http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_files_io.htm

	File related methods are in builtins package only. So, you don't need to import any additional module.
	Directories related methods are in a module called 'os'.

	Syntax: 
		file object = open(file_name [, access_mode][, buffering])

	Buffering-
		If the buffering value is set to 0, no buffering takes place. If the buffering value is 1, line buffering is performed while accessing a file. 
		If you specify the buffering value as an integer greater than 1, then buffering action is performed with the indicated buffer size. 
		If negative, the buffer size is the system default(default behavior).

	Access Modes-
		You can open a file in many modes 
		- read (r)
		- overwrite (w)
		- append (a)
		- write and read (w+)
		- append and read (a+)
		and many more

	File Attributes-
		file.closed		Returns true if file is closed, false otherwise.
		file.mode		Returns access mode with which file was opened.
		file.name		Returns name of the file.
		file.softspace	Returns false if space explicitly required with print, true otherwise.

	file.tell()-
		tells you the current position within the file; in other words, the next read or write will occur at that many bytes from the beginning of the file.

	file.seek(offset[, from])-
		changes the current file position.

	file.rename(current_file_name, new_file_name)
		renames the file

	file.remove()
		removes the file
	
	Other file related methods
		http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/file_methods.htm
	

	'os' module
		'os' module has many methods related to directories.
	
		import os

		os.mkdir("test")  --- make a new directory
		os.chdir("newdir") --- change the current directory
		os.getcwd() --- give location of current directory
		os.rmdir("dirname") --- removes	directory

	Other directories related methods
		http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/os_file_methods.htm


	e.g. 

		file = open("readwritefile.txt","r+",1);

		if(not file.closed):
			print("Reading the file\n")
			print(file.read())

			# Check current position
			position = file.tell();
			print("postition: "+str(position)) # 63 (end of the file

			# Reposition pointer at the beginning once again
			position = file.seek(0, 0);
			print("postition: "+str(position)) # 0

			print("\n\nReading the file till 10th position")
			print(file.read(10))

			position = file.tell();
			print("postition: "+str(position)) # 10

			file.close()

Exception handling
------------------
	Exceptions:
		http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_exceptions.htm
		Unlike to Java, Python has only Unchecked exceptions. It means that it is not mandatory to catch any exception in Python.
		You can see all types of exceptions - http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/standard_exceptions.htm
	Assertions:
		http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/assertions_in_python.htm

	try block:
	except block:
		A single try statement can have multiple except statements.
	else block:
		After the except clause(s), you can include an else-clause.
		The code in the else-block executes if the code in the try block does not raise an exception.
		The else-block is a good place for code that does not need the try: block's protection.
	finally block:
		It is just like Java's finally block.

	syntax of try-except-else-finally block:

		try:
		   You do your operations here;
		   ......................
		except ExceptionI:
		   If there is ExceptionI, then execute this block.
		except ExceptionII:
		   If there is ExceptionII, then execute this block.
		   ......................
		else:
		   If there is no exception then execute this block.
		finally:
			This would always be executed.


		Handling multiple exceptions together

			try:
			   You do your operations here;
			   ......................
			except(Exception1[, Exception2[,...ExceptionN]]]):
			   If there is any exception from the given exception list,
			   then execute this block.
			   ......................
			else:
			   If there is no exception then execute this block.
			finally:
				This would always be executed.

		try-finally (without except)

			try:
			   You do your operations here;
			finally:
				This would always be executed.

	Raising an Exceptions:
		An exception can be a string, a class or an object.
		syntax:
			raise [Exception [, args [, traceback]]]
	

	e.g.
		import random
		import os

		try:
			# open a file only for reading

			randomNo = random.randint(1, 10)
			fileName = "onlyforread" + str(randomNo) + ".txt"
			if(os._exists()):
				os.remove(fileName) # just want to raise an exception and trying to open a file after deleting it
			file = open(fileName, "r")
		except IOError:
			print("file doesn't exist")
		except:
			print("some other exception")
		#else:
			#  else block is executed, if exception is not raised from try block
		finally:
			file = open("onlyforread" + str(randomNo) + ".txt", "w+")
			file.write("I am happy")

			if(not file.closed):
				file.close()


		# Example of raising an error using custom error class
		# Custom Error class extending RuntimeError
		class Networkerror(RuntimeError):
			def __init__(self, arg):
				assert(arg  != None), "No error message supplied"
				super().__init__(arg)

		try:
		   raise Networkerror("Bad hostname")
		except Networkerror as e:
		   # print(e.__str__())
		   # or
		   print(e)


		# Example of raising a string error
		def fun(level):
			try:
			   if(not level or level == 0):
				   raise "Invalid level!"

			except "Invalid level!" as e:
			   print(e)
			else:
			   print("level: "+str(level))

		#fun(0) # to raise an exception
		fun(1)	


Date and Time
-------------
	http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_date_time.htm

	Python Modules related to time and calendar
		- time
		- calendar

	In Python, time can be retrieved in Seconds, TimeTuple, Formatted Time
	Python also provides a capability of displaying Calendar.

	e.g.

		import time, calendar

		timeInSeconds = time.time()
		print("Time in seconds: "+ str(timeInSeconds)) # Time in seconds: 1464043435.923485

		# converting seconds to time-tuple
		# TimeTuple is nothing but just a record of time related attributes like tm_year, tm_mon, tm_mday, tm_hour, tm_min, tm_sec etc.
		timeTupleOfLocalTime = time.localtime(timeInSeconds)
		print("Time Tuple: "+ str(timeTupleOfLocalTime)) # Time Tuple: time.struct_time(tm_year=2016, tm_mon=5, tm_mday=23, tm_hour=15, tm_min=45, tm_sec=36, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=144, tm_isdst=1)

		# time.ctime(seconds) function
		print("ctime(seconds) is same as asktime(timeTuple)" + str(time.ctime(timeInSeconds))) # Mon May 23 15:52:49 2016

		# time.gmtime(seconds) give UTC time
		print("UTC TimeTuple: "+ str(time.gmtime(timeInSeconds))) # UTC time: time.struct_time(tm_year=2016, tm_mon=5, tm_mday=23, tm_hour=23, tm_min=3, tm_sec=28, tm_wday=0, tm_yday=144, tm_isdst=0)

		# Formatting TimeTuple
		formattedTime = time.asctime(timeTupleOfLocalTime)
		print("Formatted Time: "+formattedTime) # Formatted Time: Mon May 23 15:50:51 2016

		# time.clock() returns the current CPU time as a floating-point number of seconds. To measure computational costs of different approaches, the value of time.clock is more useful than that of time.time().
		print("CPU time: "+ str(time.clock()))

		# time.strptime(time in some format, format) will return a tuple of TimeTuple attributes
		# http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/time_strptime.htm
		struct_time = time.strptime("30 Nov 00", "%d %b %y")
		print("returned tuple: %s" % str(struct_time)) # returned tuple: time.struct_time(tm_year=2000, tm_mon=11, tm_mday=30, tm_hour=0, tm_min=0, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=3, tm_yday=335, tm_isdst=-1)


		# calendar is module in Python that you can use to display a calendar
		print("Calendar:\n"+calendar.month(2016, 1))
		"""

Database Access
---------------
	http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_database_access.htm

	1) Download and install MySql DB from 'https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/'
	To start MySql DB, go to 'System Preferences->click on mysql'. This will open MySql Preferences window. You can start and stop MySql from there..

	2) Install MySql workbench. It is just like 'SQL Developer'

	3) Download and install MySql Python package
	You have installed Python 3. Default installation is Python 2.7.x on mac.
	Python 3 is installed at "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5" in mac

	> python --version
	Python 2.7.6

	> python3 --version
	Python 3.5.1

	So, there are two different commands

	For MySql or any other DB, you need to install a package. It doesn't come with default Python installation.
	MySql package for Python 3 is at 'https://pypi.python.org/pypi/mysqlclient'
	Go to mysqlclient>
				python3 setup.py build
				python3 setup.py install
			
	This will install mysql package at "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.5/lib/python3.5/site-packages"

	4) create a schema in mysql called 'myschema' and create a table 'employee' with cols id and name.

	e.g.
		import MySQLdb  # You need to import this module
	
		# Open database connection
		db = MySQLdb.connect("localhost", "root", "admin", "myschema")

		# prepare a cursor object using cursor() method
		cursor = db.cursor()

		# execute SQL query using execute() method.
		cursor.execute("SELECT VERSION()")

		# Fetch a single row using fetchone() method.
		data = cursor.fetchone()
		print("Database version : %s " % data)

		try:
			# Execute the SQL command
			cursor.execute("select * from employee")
			# Fetch all the rows in a list of lists.
			results = cursor.fetchall()
			for row in results:
				#print(row)
				id = row[0]
				name = row[1]
				# Now print fetched result
				print("id=%d,name=%s" % \
					  (id, name))

		except Exception as e:
			print("Error: unable to fecth data: " + e)  # disconnect from server

		db.close()

Multi Threading
---------------
	http://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_multithreading.htm

	Two ways to implement threads in Python.

	1. use thread.start_new_thread ( function, args[, kwargs] )
	This method call enables a fast and efficient way to create new threads in both Linux and Windows.

	2. use 'threading' module and then you can do 
	class myThread (threading.Thread):

	Python provides various options for developing graphical user interfaces (GUIs). 
		- Tkinter
		- wxPython
		- JPython

	It is just like AWT/Swing in Java.

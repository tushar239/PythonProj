DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)

DBSCAN groups together points that are close to each other (i.e., dense regions) and marks points in sparse regions as outliers.

eps	- Radius to search for neighboring points
min_samples	- Minimum number of points required to form a dense region (cluster)
Core Point - A point with at least min_samples neighbors within eps
Border Point - Fewer neighbors than min_samples, but in the neighborhood of a core
Noise Point	- Not a core or border â€” outlier

Tips for Use
Choosing eps is critical! Use k-distance graph to tune it.
Too small eps: Too many outliers.
Too large eps: All points may be one big cluster.

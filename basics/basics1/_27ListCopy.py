"""
You cannot copy a list simply by typing list2 = list1,
because: list2 will only be a reference to list1, and changes made in list1 will automatically also be made in list2

There are ways to make a copy, one way is to use the built-in List method copy().

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
mylist = list(thislist)
print(mylist)  # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

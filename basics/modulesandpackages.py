Naming Python modules

A Python module is a collection of reusable code that is inside a file with extension “.py” and which can be imported inside another Python program.
Typically, a module contains a set of functions that is helpful to break down a program into manageable parts.
Similar to files and functions, modules should be named in lowercase characters with an underscore used when the name is too long.
It is recommended that modules be named with just a single word.


Naming Python packages

A Python package is a collection of modules. It is typically a folder containing modules and maybe other folders each of which can contain more modules and/or folders.
A package folder typically contains a file called “__init__.py” which is a way to signal to Python that this folder is a package. The contents of “__init__.py” typically
contain code to be executed upon package initialization within a larger program.

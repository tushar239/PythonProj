The CPython implementation of dictionaries uses a sparse table that contains indices into another, dense table holding the actual order of keys and values.
When a new item is inserted, it goes into the next available slot in the dense table, thus preserving order. When items are deleted, the algorithm maintains the order of the remaining items, ensuring that the order reflects the sequence of insertion and deletion.

List -  ordered, changeable, duplicates allowed.
Tuple - ordered, unchangeable, duplicates allowed
        tuple is UNCHANGEABLE.
        If you want to change anything in it, you have to first create a list from that tuple, change it and then covert that list back to tuple.
Set -   unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. duplicates are NOT allowed.
        *Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove and/or add items whenever you like.
Dictionary - ordered** and changeable. duplicate keys not allowed.
        **As of Python version 3.7, dictionaries are ordered. In Python 3.6 and earlier, dictionaries are unordered.

        https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/are-python-dictionaries-ordered/
        The CPython implementation of dictionaries uses a sparse table that contains indices into another, dense table holding the actual order of keys and values.
        When a new item is inserted, it goes into the next available slot in the dense table, thus preserving order. When items are deleted, the algorithm maintains the order of the remaining items, ensuring that the order reflects the sequence of insertion and deletion.

        The implementation of ordered dictionaries in Python is highly optimized.
        For most use cases, the overhead introduced by maintaining order is negligible.
        However, it's always good practice for developers to be mindful of potential performance implications
        when working with large data sets or in performance-critical applications

Python List vs Numpy Array
    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-lists-vs-numpy-arrays/
    Python list is like LinkedList whereas Numpy Array is like ArrayList
    Python list can contain different type of data whereas Numypy array can contain same type of data only.
    Numpy array has faster mathematical operations compared to Python List.

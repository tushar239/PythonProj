Numpy supports vectorized operations.

Numpy arrays are homogeneous in nature means it is an array that contains data of a single type only.
Pythonâ€™s lists and tuples are unrestricted in the type of data they contain.
The concept of vectorized operations on NumPy allows the use of more optimal and pre-compiled functions and mathematical operations on NumPy array objects and data sequences.
The Output and Operations will speed up when compared to simple non-vectorized operations.

Array operations are carried out in C and hence the universal functions in numpy are faster than
operations carried out on python lists.
